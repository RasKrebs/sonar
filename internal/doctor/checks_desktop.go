//
// It reads the config first, because that is the only source that knows the
// *version* — the record `sonar install desktop` leaves behind — and falls
// back to the same lookup tray does, so an app installed by some other means
// (a .deb, a drag into /Applications) is still reported as installed rather
// than as missing. A recorded path that no longer exists is the interesting
// third case: the config says one thing and the disk says another, and the
// same one command fixes it.
